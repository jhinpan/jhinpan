## Hi there, I'm [Jin Pan(æ½˜åŠ² in Chinese)!](https://jhinpan.github.io/) ðŸ‘‹

I am a first-year graduate student in the traditional M.S./Ph.D. program in Computer Sciences at the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Alongside my studies, I actively contribute to the [SGLang community](https://docs.sglang.ai/), focusing on enhancing LLM inference systems. My academic background includes undergraduate degrees in Computer Science Engineering from the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), where I engaged with the [Human Factors Group at UMTRI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-michigan-transportation-research-institute/) and the [Human-Centered Computing Laboratory](https://hcc.engin.umich.edu/), and in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

## Research Interests ðŸ”­

My research primarily focuses on:
- **ML Systems**: Topics related to **SGLang**, **AI Infra**, and **High Performance Computing**.
- **RLHF for Agents**: Topics related to **Post-training** and **RLHF for Multi-Agent Systems**.
- **Extended Reality**: Topics related to **Virtual Reality** and **Augmented Reality**.

## Updates ðŸ˜„

- I'm excited to share that I will be joining the AMD GenAI Team this summer, focusing on RL Systems!
