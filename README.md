### Hi there, I'm [Jin Pan(æ½˜åŠ² in Chinese)!](https://jhinpan.github.io/) ðŸ‘‹

I am a first-year graduate student in the traditional M.S./Ph.D. program in Computer Sciences at the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Previously, I had the privilege of studying Computer Science Engineering within the [Human Factors Group at UMTRI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-michigan-transportation-research-institute/) and the [Human-Centered Computing Laboratory](https://hcc.engin.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/). Before joining UMich, I pursued my other undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).


ðŸ”­ **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:
- **ML System**: topics related to **SGLang**, **AI Infra** as well as **High Performance Computing**
- **RLHF For Agents**: topics related to **Post-training** and **RLHF for Multi-Agents System**
- **Extended Reality**: topics related to **Virtual Reality** and **Augmented Reality**

ðŸ˜„ **I am glad to share that**:
